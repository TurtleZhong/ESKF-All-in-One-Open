## Error State Kalman Filter All in One, from Theory to Practice.

Author:xinliangzhong@foxmail.com

### ~~coming soon~~

### I am sorry that this project may update slowly.

This project aims to realize Localization methods based on `Error State Kalman Filter`([ESKF]()). For some reason, We may only release theory(Including formula derivation, reference papers, etc.), Codes will be released if Possiable. We also release some results of our method(Including dataset we used, localization gif, etc.).

`Need A tabel here to summary all the method`

## 1.ESKF theory

## 2.Localization Method based on ESKF
### 2.1 Recover Rotation Using IMU
### 2.2 GPS + IMU Localization
### 2.3 Wheel Encoder + IMU Localization
### 2.4 GPS + IMU + Wheel Encoder Localizaton
### 2.5 Mono + IMU Localization
### 2.6 Stereo + IMU Localization
### 2.7 Mono/Stereo + IMU + GPS Localization
### 2.8 Mono/Stereo + IMU + GPS + Wheel Encoder Localization
### 2.9 Lidar + IMU Localization
### 2.10 Lidar + IMU + Wheel Encoder
### 2.11 ...+GPS

...Oh s**t I guess it is a big project, So may be update slowly. Also I will compare some other method, Such as OpenVINS, LIO-Mapping etc.
